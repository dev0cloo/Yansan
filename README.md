# Yansan - A Decentralized Blockchain Platform

Yansan is a blockchain platform that lets you simulate transactions between users and add new blocks to the blockchain, all written in the popular and accessible programming language, JavaScript. Yansan provides a hands-on experience with blockchain technology, helping you to understand how it works.

## Features
- Simulate transactions between users.
- Add new blocks to the blockchain.
- Validate the integrity of the blockchain.
- Written in JavaScript, a popular and accessible programming language.

## Requirements
- Node.js installed.

## How to Try It Out
1. Clone Yansan locally from the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm.
3. To add transactions, run the following command in the terminal: ```node add-transactions.js Me You 32```
where `Me` is the sender's address, `You` is the recipient address, and `32` is the amount transferred. 
The transactions will be added to the transaction pool (`transactions.json`).
4. To add new blocks to the blockchain, run the following command in the terminal: ```node add-block.js```
5. To validate the integrity of the blockchain, run the following command in the terminal: 
```node validate-chain.js```

That's it! You can now start simulating transactions, adding new blocks, and validating the integrity of the Yansan blockchain.
